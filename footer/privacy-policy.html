        <p></p>
        <p><strong>5. BENEFICIARIES AND TRANSFER TO A THIRD COUNTRY</strong></p>
        <p>The data obtained through the web form shall not be made available by the joint controllers to any recipients and shall not be transferred to a third country or to an international organization.</p>

        <p><strong>d. Right to erase (right to be forgotten)</strong></p>
        <p>In some cases stipulated by law, we are obliged to delete the personal data of the data subject. However, each such request is subject to an individual assessment of whether the conditions are met, because, as the controller, we may be bound by a legal obligation or we may process personal data on the basis of a legitimate interest. If our legitimate interest (or the legitimate interest of a third party) outweighs the interests of the data subject, we are entitled to further process the personal data for the purpose in question.</p>
        <p><strong>e. Right to restriction of the processing</strong></p>
        <p>The data subject may request the controller to restrict the processing of personal data if any of the following situations occurs:</p>
        <p>- the data subject has denied the accuracy of the personal data for the time necessary for the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data;</p>
        <p>- the processing of personal data is unlawful, but the data subject refuses to delete the data and instead requests a restriction on their use;</p>
        <p>- the controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of processing, but requests the data subject to determine, enforce or defend legal claims;</p>
        <p>- the data subject has objected to the processing of personal data in specific situations under the GDPR (public interest task, legitimate interest of the controller or profiling), until it is verified that the legitimate interests of the controller outweigh the legitimate interests of the data subject.</p>
        <p><strong>f. Right to data portability</strong></p>
        <p>If the data subject requests that we transfer his personal data to another controller, we shall transfer the personal data in the appropriate format, unless we are prevented from doing so by any legal or other significant obstacles, to the designated entity.</p>
        <p><strong>g. The right to object to automated individual decision-making</strong></p>
        <p>The data subject may at any time object to the processing of personal data by the controller for the purposes of direct marketing carried out on the basis of a legitimate interest of the controller and whenever we process personal data on the basis of a legitimate interest or public interest, including profiling.</p>
        <p><strong>h. Consent-based processing (right to withdraw consent)</strong></p>
        <p>Where the processing is based on the consent of the data subject within the meaning of Article 6 (1), 1 letter (a) of the GDPR or Article 9 (1); 1 letter a) of the GDPR, the data subjects have the right to withdraw their consent at any time. Such withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on the consent given prior to its withdrawal.</p>
        <p><strong>i. The right to submit a proposal, complaint, complaint to the supervisory body</strong></p>
        <p>The data subjects may at any time file a proposal, initiative or complaint regarding the processing of personal data with the supervisory body, which is the Office for Personal Data Protection of the Slovak Republic, with its registered office at Hraničná 12, 820 07 Bratislava 27, Slovak Republic, tel. no .: +421/2/3231 3220, website: www.uoou.sk.</p>
        <p><strong>Deadline for reply</strong></p>
        <p>We will provide a statement and, if necessary, information on the measures taken as soon as possible, but no later than within one month. We are entitled to extend the deadline by two months if necessary and due to the complexity and number of applications. We will inform the data subject about the extension of the deadline, including the reason.</p>
        <p><strong>Contact point</strong></p>
        <p>The individual rights may be exercised by the data subjects with the controller by e-mail address: peter.hospodar(at)continiumtech.com or in writing to the correspondence address: Krankenhausstr. 36, D-83043 Bad Aibling, Germany.</p>
        <p>We provide all notices and statements about the exercised rights free of charge. However, if the request is manifestly unfounded or disproportionate, in particular because it is repeated, we are entitled to charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs or to refuse to act on the request. In the case of repeated applications for copies of processed personal data, we reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee for administrative costs.</p>
        <p><strong>8. PROVISION OF PERSONAL DATA</strong></p>
        <p>The provision of personal data to the web form is voluntary, and therefore the provision of data to us as the controller, as we are a private entity, is not a legal requirement. If you are interested in concluding a contract with us, the provision of personal data may be necessary for the conclusion of a contract. In this case, the provision is a contractual requirement. The data subject is not obliged to provide his personal data, he provides it voluntarily. Refusal to provide personal data does not have negative consequences for the data subject.</p>
        <p><strong>9. AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING AND PROFILING</strong></p>
        <p>The controller does not use the so-called automated individual decision-making, including profiling.</p>
        <p><strong>10. PROCESSING FOR ANOTHER PURPOSE</strong></p>
        <p>When processing, we respect the principle of limiting the purpose limitation, it means that we process data only on the basis of a specified, explicitly stated and legitimate purpose, except in the case of processing for a compatible purpose. Processing for another purpose may also be based on the consent of the person concerned, European Union law or the law of Slovak Republic. To find out whether another purpose is compatible with the purpose for which the personal data were originally obtained, before processing, we perform the so-called compatibility test, in which we take into account:</p>
        <p>a. any link between the purposes for which the personal data were obtained and the purposes of the intended further processing;</p>
        <p>b. the circumstances in which the personal data were obtained, in particular as regards the relationship between the data subjects and the controller;</p>
        <p>c. the nature of the personal data, in particular whether specific categories of personal data are processed pursuant to Article 9 of the GDPR or personal data relating to the criminalization of criminal offenses and offenses pursuant to Article 10 of the GDPR;</p>
        <p>d. the possible consequences of the intended further processing for the persons concerned;</p>
        <p>e. the existence of adequate safeguards, which may include encryption or pseudonymisation.</p>
        <p><strong>11. OVERVIEW OF SELECTED LEGISLATION IN THE FIELD OF PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION</strong></p>
        <p>- Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (Article 8);</p>
        <p>- Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, repealing Directive 95/46 / EC (General Data Protection Regulation);</p>
        <p>- Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) (consolidated version);</p>

        <p>- Decree no. 158/2018 Coll. Office for Personal Data Protection of the Slovak Republic on the procedure for assessing the impact on personal data protection.</p>
        <p><strong>12. CHANGES TO THE RULES FOR THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA</strong></p>
        <p>We are entitled to change the wording of these rules for the processing of personal data, especially in the case of the need to incorporate legislative changes or changes in the purpose and means of processing. In the event that there are changes in the rules of personal data processing that would be capable of affecting the rights of the data subjects, we will notify them in a suitable manner in good time.</p>
