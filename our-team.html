            <p>After his A-level (Matura) on gymnasium for mathematic talents in Pressburg (est. 1626) he studied electrical engineering at TU Ilmenau. Already during his diploma thesis in 1995 he designed his first ADC for UV sensor dosimeter. 1996, upon his Dipl-Ing./MSc graduation Richard started his post-graduate research study in the field of analog neuromorphic auditory VLSI systems and implemented a different CMOS version of spiking neurons. In 1999 he joined the semi-industrial research institute IMMS Erfurt as ADC group leader and analog designer. During his 5 years leadership he established the ADC group from zero level to a skilled design group with successfully completed industrial contracts (Siemens, GEMAC/AMAC) and research project by first time right silicon ADCs. After defending his PhD thesis externally in 2004, he joined Heidenhain motion control as analog IC designer for rotary encoders. In 2009 he returned to data converter IC industry when joining National Semiconductor design center for CTSD (continuous time Sigma Delta) ADC for wireless base stations. Since 2011 he is entrepreneur and has been successfully working as an analog and mixed signal ASIC design consultant in Munich, building up a skilled ASIC design team from scretch, and finally founding Continium Technologies in Germany and Slovakia.</p>
